Chip 8 Emulator

This project is a basic chip 8 emulator that is currently hard coded to only play space invaders.  

The purpose of this project was mainly to get a feeling for writing an emulator before moving on to a more ambitious project.
The current state is a working emulator that runs on OSX.  There is lots of clean up to be done, that I will probably never do now that I feel it is workng enough to move on to the next project.  

Things to change or keep in mind for the next project.
Do more planning before hand. 
* Choices for video, audio, keyboard input should be made earlier. 
* Being unfamiliar with SDL, most of the code feels slapped together. 
* Consider implementing a dissasembler for debugging purposes.  
* Be more consious of cross platform support.
